Classic literature illustration image generation pipeline project from October 2024 Hackathon.

Reads in an eBook object, building contextually accurate images for each dynamically defined "page"; multi-paragraph pages work better for more dense material, like The Hobbit, whereas single or double paragraph pages provide better visual cues for faster moving material like chapter books.

Primary purpose is to create engaging visual anchors to help young readers connect with dense material that requires a longer mental context window.

AI inference based on open source Mistral-Nemo (local) for LLM processing and Flux.1-Schnell (hosted) for image generation.
